 		<h1> MOUCHETTE </h1>
  				<h2> Martin Neddam</h2>
  					</div>
 		
  		<div class="col col-3">Mouchette set up her first home page in 1996 and has maintained a constantly expanding web presence ever since. 
  					A fictional adolescent girl, fascinated by suicide and strangers, Mouchette is the long-running work of Amsterdam-based
  					artist Martine Neddam. Her labyrinthine, ever-growing site makes use of expressive HTML elements to involve the viewer
  					in the turbulent emotional world of an adolescent girl. Participation is central, and visitors are encouraged to talk
  					An earlier point in Mouchette's trajectory can be glimpsed in Mouchette’s contribution to the web zine Why Not Sneeze? in 1997, also presented here. The page is covered with small pebbles and crawling ants, who seem almost to crawl on the viewer’s screen. Suggestive phrases like “a little further .....” encourage the visitor to "touch" the screen with the mouse in search of a hidden link.
  					</div>
  		
  		<div class="col col-6">As a character who doubles as a platform for exchange, Mouchette has 
  					for two decades provoked her visitors into contributing in their own ways
  					to a site that now stands as a singular and important archive of online
  					culture—humorous, dark, and often surprisingly touching.
  					Mouchette’s personal website, hosted at mouchette.org, is by now a vast trove of pages. Neddam continues to spend hours per week keeping it up to date, adding new works, moderating comments, and fixing deprecated code. Liveness is crucial to Neddam’s practice, so the work featured in this online exhibition is a direct link to her live site.

  		One transparent gif on Why Not Sneeze? links back to Mouchette’s profile page, which drew on and amplified the playful kinds of self-presentation on the early web. Her bio, unchanged since the beginning of the project, expands on the classic internet mantra of Age/Sex/Location, but not by much. “My name is Mouchette. I live in Amsterdam. I am an artist. I am nearly 13 years old.”</div>

  		 			<p class="p-mou">At that time, Mouchette's own site also offered links to several multi-user
  					virtual worlds that she frequented, including instructions for finding her, or
  					an interactive bot that she created. She directed visitors to text-based worlds
  					called MOOs and to a pictorial one known as ThePalace.</p>

  		 			<p class="p-mou">One of the most active discussions on Mouchette's website was on the topic
  					of suicide. “What is the best way to kill yourself when you’re 13?” Mouchette
  					asked in 1997, inviting users to respond via a form. This discussion grew rapidly
  					and changed as the web did. When it launched in 1998, it was a frank but sardonic
  					conversation with an arts audience, but by 1999 it had become an increasingly urgent 
  					discussion of a social fact which had few other public arenas.</p>

  		 			<p class="p-mou">In addition to serious discussions, users also submitted fan art, including
  					net art works and comics featuring Mouchette. In 2003, Neddam expanded fan
  					involvement by launching a new site, Mouchette.net, which allowed visitors
  					to claim the identity of Mouchette, altering her personal website and sending
  					email from her address.</p>

  		 			<p class="p-mou">For Neddam, the loading of a page is a performative event, often marked by
  			a sound such as a coyote’s scream or the moaning of a young girl.</p>

  		 			<p class="p-mou">Throughout the project, Mouchette promised many public
  		 			appearances, but never actually materialized. In 1997, her appearance at
  		 			the Triple X Festival in Amsterdam was announced, but in her stead she sent
  		 			René Paul Vallentgoed, an agent who represented poets for live readings.
  		 			In a much-heralded appearance at Postmasters Gallery in New York, Mouchette
  		 			revealed herself to be a "very polite Frenchman."</p>

  		 			<p class="p-mou">The anonymity of Mouchette’s creator was carefully
  		 			maintained for more than a decade in order to allow more space for visitors 
  		 			to invent the character in their own way. This anonymity particularly fueled
  		 			debates about the sexualization of adolescent girlhood in the project.
  		 			Mouchette invited visitors to “taste her tongue” via the screen and laced
  		 			many aspects of the site with references to sex, rape, and incest.</p>

  		 			<p class="p-mou">Mouchette’s subjectivity comes across most through
  		 			the design of her site. Images, often created with a flatbed scanner,
  		 			seem to press up against the surface of the screen, with detailed
  		 			textures of skin, flowers, and meat, as well as swarms of insect gifs
  		 			creating an ever-present sense of decay.</p>
