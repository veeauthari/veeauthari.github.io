  				<h2> Martin Neddam</h2>
  					</div>
 		
  		<div class="col col-3">Mouchette set up her first home page in 1996 and has maintained a constantly expanding web presence ever since. 
  					A fictional adolescent girl, fascinated by suicide and strangers, Mouchette is the long-running work of Amsterdam-based
  					artist Martine Neddam. Her labyrinthine, ever-growing site makes use of expressive HTML elements to involve the viewer
  					in the turbulent emotional world of an adolescent girl. Participation is central, and visitors are encouraged to talk
  					An earlier point in Mouchette's trajectory can be glimpsed in Mouchette’s contribution to the web zine Why Not Sneeze? in 1997, also presented here. The page is covered with small pebbles and crawling ants, who seem almost to crawl on the viewer’s screen. Suggestive phrases like “a little further .....” encourage the visitor to "touch" the screen with the mouse in search of a hidden link.
  					</div>
  		
  		<div class="col col-6">As a character who doubles as a platform for exchange, Mouchette has 
  					for two decades provoked her visitors into contributing in their own ways
  					to a site that now stands as a singular and important archive of online
  					culture—humorous, dark, and often surprisingly touching.
  					Mouchette’s personal website, hosted at mouchette.org, is by now a vast trove of pages. Neddam continues to spend hours per week keeping it up to date, adding new works, moderating comments, and fixing deprecated code. Liveness is crucial to Neddam’s practice, so the work featured in this online exhibition is a direct link to her live site.

  		One transparent gif on Why Not Sneeze? links back to Mouchette’s profile page, which drew on and amplified the playful kinds of self-presentation on the early web. Her bio, unchanged since the beginning of the project, expands on the classic internet mantra of Age/Sex/Location, but not by much. “My name is Mouchette. I live in Amsterdam. I am an artist. I am nearly 13 years old.”</div>
