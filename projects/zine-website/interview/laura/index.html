    				<p class="a">  Laura Coombs is a graphic designer (the only designer in new museum)
    				in New York, currently the Senior Designer at the New Museum of Contemporary Art and a Visiting
    				Professor at Pratt. </p>

			<div class="row">
  				<div class="column-2">
    				<p class="q-2">you said you’re the only designer at the new museum,
    				so does that mean everything has to go through you or you design
    				everything and make every decision?</p>
  			</div>
  			<div class="column-2">
    				<p class="a">i make all the design and decisions, but i also work with
    				people outside my department if its regarding the actual museum site.
    				i talk to the marketing and get a clear from them as well as the other departments</p>

    				<p class="q">was this the only politically engage or art activism work
    				that you’ve done</p>
  			</div>
  			<div class="column-3">
    				<p class="a">after my grad school at yale my first book was a work i did
    				for women photography. documentation of women photographed that illustrates
    				the impact they they had to the medium. I think i also would be careful in
    				using the word and term </p>
  				</div>

			<div class="row">
  				<div class="column-4">
    				<p class="q">how did you came about to this project?</p>
  			</div>
  			<div class="column-4">
    				<p class="a">shira reached out to me same as nicole was approached,
    				and it felt very personal to her. there are factors why i participated,
    				shira is my friend shes a very respectable designer and i very much respect
    				her as a person, i love the people that are contributing into this cause and
    				i also respect them as well, and lastly of course the
    				<span class="showhim"><a class="cause" href="#">cause</a> itself.
    					<span class="showme">it is very upsetting what happened and she was,
    				as well as the rest of the contributors were, very upset with all the children
    				that are detained and separated she felt like she needed to do it. </span>
    						<span class="ok">

			<div class="row">
  				<div class="column-5">
    				<p class="q">was there a purpose or reasoning behind the orange and blue?</p>
  			</div>
  			<div class="column-5">
    				<p class="a">i think it was an interpretation that can be seen differently
    				with different people. it could be a literal separation of two different colors. </p>
  				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
  				<div class="column-6">
    				<p class="q">what was the reason behind your design?</p>
  			</div>
  			<div class="column-6">
    				<p class="a">it felt very personal this whole project and mine was a set of
    				images. pictures of 
    				<span class="showhim-1"><a class="thistle" href="#">thistle's</a>
    					<span class="showme-1"><img class="thistle-pic" src="../../img/laura/laura.png"></span>
    						<span class="ok-1">
    					</span>
    				</span>
    				and also childhood pictures on top of it in 4
    				different pictures. the 4 sort of looks like a window in a way, you looking
    				out a window. i remember when i was a kid playing out in the garden with my
    				brother, in texas. i was born in texas, grew up in texas. one memory i
    				remember was my brother picking up a thistle and giving it to me. it was
    				such a lovely memory that i can’t imagine what it feels like being separated
    				from my family, the children separated from their parents and siblings, i
    				never want to feel like that. and it just makes me so upset. so i think in a
    				way i brought my own personal memory to a personal project.</p>

			<div class="row">
  				<div class="column-7">
    				<p class="q">do you think you’re gonna work on projects like this soon or
    				focus of newmuseum and teaching first?</p>
  			</div>
  			<div class="column-7">
    				<p class="a">yeah, i think im gonna stick to the museum and teaching for a while.
    				i mean, if i have time and there’s something that comes up, who knows? but i think
    				i don’t have much to plan for a while yeah</p>

  				<div class="column-8">
    				<p class="q">does your project from separated influenced your other project or the other way around?</p>
  			</div>
  			<div class="column-8">
    				<p class="a">i think in a way everything kind of weaves in together.
    				it depends on what you define as activism but i did work on a couple
    				of

    				 with women, when trump was elected i also did some work regarding and
    				 commenting on that, so in a way everything sort of influenced each other</p>
  				</div>

			<div class="row">
  				<div class="column-9">
    				<p class="q">was this effective? was there something that you wish
    				you had done differently?</p>
  			</div>
  			<div class="column-9">
    				<p class="a">its a good question and it hard to tell, i think i’d love to
    				hear what other people are saying since its tricky. it wasn’t and will
    				<span class="showhim-3"><a class="never" href="#">never be the same</a>
    					<span class="showme-3">Nicole Killian also expressed similar thoughts on
    					people she believes are truly doing significant difference are people
    					that are working straight on the field.</span>
    						<span class="ok-3">
    					</span>
    				</span>
    				level as work on the ground but this at least there is something
    				that was done- i don’t know.. this is a very good project. shira funded all
    				the expense and every single copy that was sold, all the profit goes to

  				<div class="column-10">
    				<p class="q">where do you think an artists falls into this future of movement
    				with all the problems we are facing right now?</p>
  			</div>
  			<div class="column-10">
    				<p class="a">i think that morals and purpose and skills falls into it,
    				if i have the opportunity to put the time and effort to do something
    				that i feel strongly to then i will do it, i will take the opportunity.
    				again, doing graphic design work will not be the same weight, and i can’t
    				say we are doing much as work on ground, but i mean, its sort of hard,
    				the new museum- we’re part of the labor museum and i designed for the
    				<span class="showhim-4"><a class="labor" href="#">labor union</a>
    					<span class="showme-4">because there was a lot of antagonism between the museum and the workers.
    				Laura felt like she was a designer in between that which is why she felt like it was a difficult
    				position to juggle between.</span>
    						<span class="ok-4">
    					</span>
    				</span>
    				as well, and that was the sort of situation which is very difficult.
    				i obviously want to respect
    				my job and my work but also ethically, it is right to pay workers the living
    				wage and i have the skills to support the effort right? so, kind of you know,
    				you make this decision over and over and over again in your life and it depends
    				on your own values and your own ethics and what you stand for.</p>
