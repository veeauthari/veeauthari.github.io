    				<p class="a"> i grew up in buffalo new york and i studied graphic design in
   						undergrad and i finished school in germany at
   						<span class="showhim-1"><a class="bauhaus" href="#">bauhaus</a>
    					<span class="showme-1">The Staatliches Bauhaus, commonly known as the Bauhaus,
    				was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and
    				the fine arts.</span>
    						<span class="ok-1">
    					</span>
    				</span>
   						thats a while ago now. Basically, after i moved back from germany i worked
   						for a little bit at a alternative newspaper at buffalo new york
   						eventually moved to new york when i got a job at mtv. so i worked
   						at mtv and nickelodeon in my 20’s until i decided to go back to
   						grad school. i ended up going to Cranbrook academy of art and thats
   						where i got my MFA and after that i was a visiting artists at minneapolis
   						college of art and design before i ended up where i am now ive been in
   						richmond now for almost 7 years, so this is where my studio is and ive
   						been kind of back and forth between new york and a bunch of other places.</p>

    				<p class="q"> you collaborate with other artists for books and other publications? </p>
  			</div>
  			<div class="column-2">
    				<p class="a"> yeah, i was thinking about this a few days ago. i used to
    				love just talking about how collaboration is a about a queer endeavor
    				because its about this idea of a rockstar graphic designer or like this
    				idea of your doing things on your own so, collaboration is really important
    				to me. whether it be in the beginning of a project, the end, or fully through
    				the whole thing</p>

    				<p class="q">one collaboration in particular called separated, tell me
    				more about that project.</p>

  			<div class="column-3">
    				<p class="a"> that was actually a project that my colleague
    				<span class="showhim"><a class="shira" href="#">shira inbar</a>
    				<span class="showme">Shira Inbar is an independent graphic designer with an
    				edge of motion graphics and VJing. She is a founding member of Little Cinema,
    				a series of immersive film screenings at House of Yes, Brooklyn, and has made
    				work for MTV News; attempting to make cable television relevant again for teens
    				via interstitials, gifs, broadcast takeovers, and general randomness.</span>
    					<span class="ok">
    				</span>
    			</span>
    				initiated and i was very happy to be included in that project she emailed
    				me and shira also being an immigrant in new york i think the topic of
    				immigration and borders all of those things are really sensitive to her
    				specifically. that was how she initially reached out to me. </p>

    				<p class="q"> have you ever worked on anything politically engaged like
    				this? or was this the first exposure you had to this route?</p>
  			</div>
  			<div class="column-4">
    				<p class="a"> most of the work i do is politically engaged or one another.
    				thats sort of right now tabled but ive been working on this annual publication
    				with my friend <a class="sarah" href="https://visualmagic.info/about-sarah-faith-gottesdiener-modern-women/">
    				<span> sarah faith gottesdienerah </span></a>
    				its called 
    				<span class="showhim-2"><a class="issues" href="#">issues</a>
    					<span class="showme-2">For issue #3 of Issues, editors Nicole Killian
    					and Sarah Faith Gottesdiener challenged artists and writers to address
    					failure against the backdrop of late/hyper capitalism in the United States.

    					Issues, No. 3 : Failure
    					</span>
    						<span class="ok-2">
    					</span>
    				</span>
    				you can find it on printed matter website. issues is an annual publication that centers voices
    				of queer folks and people of color, writers, artists, designers, and we sort
    				of initially started it when- kind of a while ago, when we felt like there
    				weren’t a lot of outlets for people outside of Graphic Design, with a
    				<span class="showhim-3"><a class="issues" href="#">capital G and D</a>
    					<span class="showme-3">there were all this people that Nicole and Sarah were really excited about
    				and they thought "why aren’t people talking about them?" and so, that is something
    				that they were really proud of.
    					</span>
    						<span class="ok-3">
    					</span>
    				</span>
    				we havent worked on one in a while
    				but its really exciting when younger designer mention that theyve seen it,
    				because i think that- you know, we were just publishing it on our own and
    				doing as many copies as we could and we just looked at it as a platform to
    				sort of use our privilege as designers to share other work. </p>

    				<p class="q">how does this project influence your work? how does that
    				correlate to one another?</p>
  			</div>
  			<div class="column-5">
    				<p class="a">i think all work is connected so the work that i made before
    				separated informed how i approached making that piece and then that piece
    				definitely informed the next things. i guess like, through grad school
    				and 10 years later, i think my goal has been to really bridge the gaps
    				between projects and think of a work as a holistic practice. so no matter
    				if its a commission work or client work or research that im doing im tying
    				to think about how is what im doing- how can i look at it all together? how
    				do they inform each other, even if its in little ways </p>

  			<div class="column-6">
    				<p class="a">yeah, i think so. because i think that its a constant way
    				of looking at how you approach projects and what is your research practice
    				like, i think research is really important and i think that each one of us
    				brings our own lived experiences and how we see the world to projects and
    				sort of using anything that you make as an experiment and relooking at that
    				and maybe like challenging it or like figuring out if this is usually how
    				i do do things. is there a different way of me to approach it? how can i
    				surprise myself? </p>

  			<div class="column-8">
    				<p class="a">there’s a lot of things i have to say about this. actually,
    				theres a lot of artists and designers that are truly making work throughout
    				the lens of an “activists” but they don’t label themselves as that. and i 
    				think that im really interested in language and naming. i do think sometimes, 
    				unfortunately, the naming of work as an activist
    				<span class="showhim-4"><a class="deflate" href="#">deflates</a>
    					<span class="showme-4">nicole believes that the people that are truly doing
    					the hard work are people who aren't calling it an artistic practice. 
    					for example, the decolonization of the bronx and others like it.
    					</span>
    						<span class="ok-4">
    					</span>
    				</span>
    				that practice. even though, you could definitely 
    				argue that it is. i think we have a responsibility to look at the world that 
    				we live in, and think about how we are contributing to thought and change and 
    				how do we lift up and hold space with the people that we care about. so, i feel 
    				like that can really manifest in so many
    				<span class="showhim-5"><a class="manifest" href="#">different ways.</a>
    					<span class="showme-5">she gave an example of being active going from showing
    					up on the streets with your friend in your local neighborhood to being a designer 
    					that supports a non-profit organization.
    					</span>
    						<span class="ok-5">
    					</span>
    				</span>
    				there are so many different ways to be active. 
    				i personally, think that it’s important that we look at what our worlds are 
    				and contributing to the world that we live in right now. </p>
