  				<div class="introduction">We are exploring the different ideas and approaches
  				on the word "activism" and how designers relate themselves with the word.
  				This idea was originally inspired by the work Separated - Separados that we found
  				during the MOMA PS-1 book fair last fall. More explanation of that work can be found
  				below by scrolling this page. The question "what is an artist role in the word activism?" is the main topic
  				that we will mainly discuss in the provided interviews from artists that are also
  				the contributors of Separated-Separados project.

  						<p class="separated"> Separated is a catalog which contains a visual understanding
  						to the situation of migrant children being detained in camps and
  						separated from their families at the Southern U.S border. This is
  						a non-profit project as all the sales made from this project will
  						be donated to support the detained migrant children.</p>

  					<p class="h3-2"> why separated? </p>
  						<p class="why"> This issue was and still is a very concerning matter
  						as the apprehensions of migrant children crossing the southern US border without
  						any guardian continues to spike. Immigration authorities apprehended a
  						record setting of 76,020 unaccompanied minors at or near the US mexico border
  						during the 2019 fiscal year.</p>
