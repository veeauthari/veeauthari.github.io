  			<p class="intro"> Mouchette set up her first home page in 1996 and has maintained a
  			constantly expanding web presence ever since. A fictional adolescent girl,
  			fascinated by suicide and strangers, Mouchette is the long-running work of
  			Amsterdam-based artist Martine Neddam. Her labyrinthine, ever-growing site
  			makes use of expressive HTML elements to involve the viewer in the turbulent
  			emotional world of an adolescent girl. Participation is central, and visitors
  			are encouraged to talk about suicide, contribute fan art, and even adopt
  			Mouchette's identity. </p>
  			<p class="intro-2"> As a character who doubles as a platform for exchange,
  			Mouchette has for two decades provoked her visitors into contributing in their
  			own ways to a site that now stands as a singular and important archive of
  			online culture—humorous, dark, and often surprisingly touching.</p>

  		 <span class="p-mou">Mouchette’s personal website, hosted at mouchette.org, is by now a vast
  			trove of pages. Neddam continues to spend hours per week keeping it up to date,
  			adding new works, moderating comments, and fixing deprecated code. Liveness is
  			crucial to Neddam’s practice, so the work featured in this online exhibition is
  			a direct link to her live site.</span>

  		<span class="p-netscape"> One transparent gif on Why Not Sneeze? links back to Mouchette’s profile page,
  			which drew on and amplified the playful kinds of self-presentation on the early web.
  			Her bio, unchanged since the beginning of the project, expands on the classic internet
  			mantra of Age/Sex/Location, but not by much. “My name is Mouchette. I live in Amsterdam.
  			I am an artist. I am nearly 13 years old.”</span>

  		it is the only one which has a computer." </figcaption></br>
  		<span class="p-card"> At that time, Mouchette's own site also offered links to several multi-user
  			virtual worlds that she frequented, including instructions for finding her, or
  			an interactive bot that she created. She directed visitors to text-based worlds
  			called MOOs and to a pictorial one known as ThePalace. </span>

  			<p class="wattle-p">The text-based and programmable environment of the MOOs had a deep influence
  			on Neddam, who has described her character as a “little girl made of language
  			and made of text.” Early in the Mouchette project, Neddam built on this interest,
  			using computer software to create nonsense words, from which Mouchette composed poetry. </p>

  			<p class="in-p">Participation was also central to the project from the beginning. Contributions
  			from the public, via CGI form or email, were as important to Mouchette's identity
  			as any text written by Neddam or by computer software. </p>

  			<p class="suicide">One of the most active discussions on Mouchette's website was on the topic
  			of suicide. “What is the best way to kill yourself when you’re 13?” Mouchette
  			asked in 1997, inviting users to respond via a form. This discussion grew rapidly
  			and changed as the web did. When it launched in 1998, it was a frank but sardonic
  			conversation with an arts audience, but by 1999 it had become an increasingly urgent 
  			discussion of a social fact which had few other public arenas. </p>

  			<p class="mon-p">In addition to serious discussions, users also submitted fan art, including
  			net art works and comics featuring Mouchette. In 2003, Neddam expanded fan
  			involvement by launching a new site, Mouchette.net, which allowed visitors
  			to claim the identity of Mouchette, altering her personal website and sending
  			email from her address. </p>

  			<p class="cat-p">For Neddam, the loading of a page is a performative event, often marked by
  			a sound such as a coyote’s scream or the moaning of a young girl. </p>
